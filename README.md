# Double-Pointer-in-CPP
This folder contains simple C++ programs to understand **double pointers**, function pointers, memory addresses, and pointer usage in functions.

## Files

- **double_pointer.cpp** → Demonstrates single and double pointers: initialization, dereferencing at different levels, printing values, exploring memory addresses, and modifying values via a double pointer inside a function.

- **function_pointer.cpp** → Shows how to use function pointers: storing the address of a function in a pointer, calling functions via pointers, and passing functions as arguments to other functions.
